# React Component Conventions

**Building a new component? Decide its story before its route.** Whether it earns one, and the
loop for building at the story, both belong to the `storybook` skill.

## Component Shape

Use `FC` for React function components:

```tsx
import type { FC } from "react";

interface ComponentNameProps {
    label: string;
}

export const ComponentName: FC<ComponentNameProps> = ({ label }) => (
    <span>{label}</span>
);
```

For components without props, use:

```tsx
import type { FC } from "react";

export const ComponentName: FC = () => (
    <div />
);
```

Prefer an `interface ComponentNameProps` for props. Keep the props interface local unless another module needs to import it. If a component accepts `children`, import and use `ReactNode` as a type.

Define methods inside a component body — event handlers, async flows, and local helpers — as arrow-function `const`s, not `function` declarations:

```tsx
const handleSelect = (id: string) => {
    setSelectedId(id);
};

const runStream = async (agent: Agent) => {
    // ...
};
```

## Stateful Logic

Keep logic that does not read or set React state out of both the component and its hook — move it to the component's `ComponentNameService.ts` (see Extraction Rules) so it stays a pure, unit-testable function.

Extract the remaining React logic into a `useComponentName` hook when the component holds an effect, or more than one piece of state or ref. A lone `useState` passed straight down stays inline.

Read [`extracting-a-hook.md`](extracting-a-hook.md) before writing the hook — it decides the decomposition, the file names, and what the hook returns.

**The hook is the separation.** Once the stateful logic lives in a hook, splitting further into a stateful wrapper and a pure twin buys nothing by itself — it is an arbitrary division, and what it leaves behind is a **pass-through**: a component whose whole body is one element spreading the hook's return.

Split only when you can **name the file that renders the pure half without the hook** — an existing story, test, or second call site. Not one you plan to write. Otherwise call the hook in the component that owns the markup, and give that component the `"use client"`.

The gate is about the twin, not about children. A component rendering one *part* of the markup is ordinary composition — see Extraction Rules — and needs no second renderer.

## Content-Driven UI

Read [`content-driven-ui.md`](content-driven-ui.md) before either of these:

- writing the props interface of a component that renders page content — nav items, tabs, filters, anchor links, or page copy
- laying out a content-heavy page component

It decides whether that content is imported or passed in. Guessing bakes a module import into a client component that then cannot be driven from props.

## Extraction Rules

Put each meaningful component in its own `.tsx` module when it has independent reuse value, local ownership, or makes the caller clearer. Apply this structure while building new features, not only during later refactors.

Name the file after the component, for example `ChevronIcon.tsx` for `ChevronIcon`.

Splitting a component into a stateful wrapper and a pure one? Both names come from [`naming-a-split.md`](naming-a-split.md) — read it before writing either filename.

Move only component-specific markup, props, constants, and helper types into the new module. Leave caller state, effects, data arrays, and behavior in the caller unless they truly belong to the extracted component.

Use a named export for the component. Update the caller to import from the new local module. Update an `index.ts` barrel only when the folder already uses one and the component should be part of that folder's public surface.

Preserve client/server boundaries. Add `"use client";` to the extracted component only if it uses hooks, browser APIs, event handlers that require a client component boundary, or project conventions require it. Do not add it to pure presentational components by default.

When a component is a single standalone component, keep it as `ComponentName.tsx` in the parent feature folder. Do not create a same-named folder solely for a component that has no local private subcomponents, hooks, services, or folder-level public surface.

When creating or growing a component into a small local component cluster, place it in a same-named folder with a primary `ComponentName.tsx`, colocated subcomponents, hooks, or services, and an `index.ts` barrel that preserves the public import path.

A component with one caller is a nesting candidate, but caller count alone isn't the test — nest it only if it also **relays** rather than **owns**. A relay renders static or decorative markup, or forwards its caller's handlers down (at most partially applying an id), adding no handlers and no accessibility contract of its own; nothing about it sends a reader looking for it by name. An owner wires its own handlers to real controls and carries its own aria contract — a reader debugging that interaction searches for it by name, so leave it flat and top-level even with one caller today.

Nest a relay under its sole caller's same-named folder, ready to promote out if it gains a second caller. The feature's root component is already the feature folder, so its relays stay flat there.

Check actual call sites before deciding; a barrel export or a public-looking filename does not by itself mean a component is reused.

```text
photo-composer/
  BandEditor.tsx              // owner: own drag/click + aria, flat despite one caller
  CompositionPanel/
    CompositionPanel.tsx
    BandList.tsx              // relay: forwards handlers, adds none
    index.ts
```

Use `ComponentNameService.ts` for component-local data, helpers, or service-like contracts that support one component family. Avoid vague filenames such as `items.ts` when the module is effectively the component's local service boundary.
