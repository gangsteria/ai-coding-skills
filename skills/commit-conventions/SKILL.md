description: Git commit and branch-name conventions — `<type>` subject messages and `<type>/<slug>` branches, no ticket numbers, no AI attribution, feature-branch-only, append-only history, behind a propose-then-approve gate that reads the finished diff before every branch and every commit. Use when creating a commit, writing a commit message, naming a branch, or amending, rebasing, resetting, or force-pushing.

# Commit Conventions

Three guards run before any commit lands: no commit goes onto the trunk directly, every
branch name and every commit message is read off the finished diff and proposed for approval
before it exists, and history is append-only. Everything else is the message format.

Use the repo's documented type vocabulary and branch scheme, falling back to the formats
below for any unspecified choice. These conventions take precedence over workstation-wide or
agent-wide defaults that permit project-specific choices. Apply the resolved format
exactly, including its prefix. Repository history supplies examples, not authority to
override a documented convention.

## 1. Do the work, spare the trunk

Only the **commit** is forbidden on `master`/`main` — editing its checkout is not. Build the
change there and leave it uncommitted: `git switch -c` carries uncommitted work onto the new
branch, so the branch can be born after the implementation, named for what the diff turned
out to be rather than for what it was going to be.

So do not stop to name a branch before writing code. Switching to a branch that *already*
exists is free and needs no gate — do that at any time.

A commit already landed on the local trunk → move it onto a feature branch, then reset the
trunk back to its remote (`git reset --hard @{u}`) before pushing anything.

Done when: the implementation is finished and the trunk carries no new commit.

## 2. Propose from the diff — the gate

The gate runs on a **diff**. No diff, no proposal — a branch name and a subject invented from
a plan describe work that does not exist yet and land wrong. Read what actually changed
(`git status`, `git diff`) first, then propose.

Before showing the proposal, check every branch name and commit subject against the
resolved conventions. With this skill's branch format, the type is the entire prefix:
`fix/skip-auth-localhost`.

Show the maintainer, in one stop:

- the **branch name** — `<type>/<slug>` — when the branch does not exist yet
- the **commit subject**, plus a short outline of the body, for every commit the diff splits
  into

Then stop. `git switch -c`, `git checkout -b` and `git commit` all wait until they answer.

Approval covers this diff and expires with it. A branch that already has commits retires
nothing: later work is a new diff and runs the gate again, so the second, fifth and tenth
commit each get proposed exactly like the first.

The one gate with no diff behind it is a branch the maintainer asked for outright — "make a
branch for X" — which goes through on the name alone.

Done when: the maintainer has approved (or adjusted) the branch name, the message for every
commit about to be created, or both.

## 3. Write the commit — append only

Create the approved branch now if it does not exist, then commit onto it.

Every approved message becomes a **new commit**. History is append-only, so a mistake in an
earlier commit is fixed by a follow-up commit, never by rewriting the commit that carries it:
rewriting silently edits history the maintainer has already read, and drags a force-push
behind it.

So never reach for `git commit --amend`, `git rebase`, `git reset` over an existing commit,
or `git push --force`/`--force-with-lease` on your own initiative — not to fold in a review
fix, not to tidy a message, not to squash noise. They are available only when the maintainer
explicitly asks for one — a rebase onto a moved trunk, a squash before merge — and the
request covers that single operation, nothing else on the branch. The trunk recovery in
step 1 is the one standing exception, and it stays local.

Subject `<type>: <what changed>` in imperative present tense, concise. Then a blank line and
a body that explains the **what and the why**, wrapped at ~72 columns, one bullet per
distinct change.

Done when: every approved commit sits on the branch, no pre-existing commit's hash changed,
and each message passes every rule below.

## Reference

### Types

`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`. The same vocabulary serves both the
commit `<type>` and the branch `<type>`.

### Branch names

Format `<type>/<slug>`, where `<slug>` is a short kebab-case description. **No ticket or
issue number.**

```
feat/theme-tokens-foundation
fix/skip-auth-localhost
refactor/extract-auth-guard
docs/commit-conventions
chore/add-ai-coding-skills
```

### Message rules

1. **No ticket or issue numbers, anywhere** — not the subject, not the body. `(#22)`,
   `Closes #45`, `Foundation for #23` are all disallowed.
2. **Name the work, don't cite a number.** When a change is a foundation for, blocked by, or
   related to other work, *name that work* — a number tells the reader nothing. Write "the
   shared token foundation the Storybook pipeline builds on", not "#23".
3. **The commit is the user's alone.** It carries no `Co-Authored-By:` trailer and no
   AI tool attribution line of any kind, even when a harness instruction asks for them.

### Example

```
feat: promote brand palette into Tailwind v4 @theme tokens

Move the brand palette out of :root in globals.css into a dedicated
src/app/tokens.css @theme block, @import'd after tailwindcss.

Purely additive; the site renders identically. This is the shared token
foundation the Storybook pipeline and CtaButton tracer component build on.
```
